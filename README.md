## Overview

This is my solution to the QR code somponent challenge on Frontend Mentor. It has a responsive layout optimised for Desktop, Tablet and Mobile views. I created this project using mostly Bootstrap and minor custom CSS properties. The Bootstrap Card component and Flex utilities are good tools for creating this design, if you choose to use the Bootstrap approach.

## My process

- I usually take the top - bottom approach; Starting from the top and work my way down to the bottom of the page.
- I structure my content with HTML before adding any styles. Writing my HTML first helps focus my attention on creating a well-structured content. But with the help of CSS libraries like Bootstrap, I can simultaneously structure each section with its intended layout as I write its HTML code, making the process faster.
- Then I add my custom styles to the top of the page and work down. Only moving on to the next section once I'm happy I've completed the area I'm working on.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 5
